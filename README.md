# Tune Wave

Tune Wave is a simple music player made using Java.

## Will it be a thing ?

No idea I'm just playing around with Java it'll probably be a thing as long as i'm interested.




## Versions (Milestones)

- ### Version 0.1

    Played the very first mp3 file using that program.
    
    Would litereally press play "a button that was left by JavaFX" and it would just play the song.

- ### Version 0.2
    Well apparently nobody would want to play just one song that is hardcoded into the program so another button added and ðŸ¥³ we got ourselves a **NEW FEATURE** Dynamic File Loading it sounds really complex for some but it's just **literally** getting another file to play.

    Also Trying to keep the project Modular as much as I can.
